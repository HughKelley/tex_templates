\section{Section 1}

The overall goal of this work is to study how an understanding of the populations willingness to cycle in stressfull environments can inform predictions about mode of transport choice. The foundational theory is that the city's bike network looks very different to cyclists of different abilities. A highly confident cyclist can use almost any road in London, while someone just starting out may be uncomfortable anywhere with other traffic of any sort or confined spaces.
